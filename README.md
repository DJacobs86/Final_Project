Nation Parks 

## What do we intend to show:
National Park Visitation and Amenities data – We have found data about national park amenities and visitation numbers for the previous year. We would like to see if there is a correlation between any of the park amenities and the number of visitors annually. Criteria for amenities: state, lat/long, total Sites, tent only, # of electrical hook ups, showers, dump station present, host, potable water, firewood for sale.

## Technology Used:
- Data Prep – Jupyter Notebook/Python, combine and store the excel worksheets we have exported from Kaggle and the National Parks Service website. 
- Data Storage – PostgreSQL
- Statistics/Analysis - Machine Learning/Neural Networks
- Presentation – Tableau Story

## Group Roles: 
- Noor – Machine Learning/Neural Networks
- Dave - PostgreSQL
- Robert - Tableau
